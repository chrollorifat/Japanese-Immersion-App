## üöÄ Getting Started Tomorrow

1. **Set up your development environment** using `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
2. **Start with text extraction** - get one ebook processed and displayed
3. **Take it one step at a time** - don't try to implement everything at once
4. **Ask questions** - don't hesitate to ask for help when needed

Remember: This is a learning journey, not a race. Focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than rushing through features. Each challenge you overcome will make you a better developer!

Good luck with your Japanese learning app! üáØüáµ‚ú®
