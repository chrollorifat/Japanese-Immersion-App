## 🔥 Next Steps (Start Here!)

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment** (30 minutes)
Follow the detailed guide in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`:
- Install Python, PostgreSQL, and VS Code
- Create virtual environment and install dependencies
- Set up database and environment variables
- Run the application for the first time

### 2. **Test the Basic Functionality** (15 minutes)
- Start the backend server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Open the frontend: `frontend/templates/index.html`
- Create a user account and test login/logout
- Try uploading a simple text file as a book

### 3. **Your First Development Task** (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Display uploaded book content in the reader

**What you'll learn**:
- File reading in Python
- Database queries with SQLAlchemy
- HTML templating
- Basic debugging

**Steps**:
1. Create a simple text file with Japanese content
2. Upload it through the interface
3. Modify the book model to store extracted text
4. Create a basic reader page to display the content

## 📚 Learning Path

### **Beginner Phase (Weeks 1-4)**
- Focus on: Text processing, basic reader interface
- You'll learn: File handling, HTML/CSS, JavaScript basics
- Goal: Read uploaded ebooks in the browser

### **Intermediate Phase (Weeks 5-8)**
- Focus on: Japanese text analysis, dictionary integration
- You'll learn: APIs, data processing, user interaction
- Goal: Click words to see definitions

### **Advanced Phase (Weeks 9-12)**
- Focus on: SRS system, learning analytics
- You'll learn: Algorithms, data visualization, complex features
- Goal: Complete spaced repetition system

### **Expert Phase (Weeks 13-16)**
- Focus on: AI integration, advanced features
- You'll learn: Machine learning APIs, optimization, polish
- Goal: Production-ready application

## 🎯 Your Immediate Priorities

### Today:
1. ✅ You've built the foundation (DONE!)
2. 📖 Read through `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
3. 🛠️ Set up your development environment

### This Week:
1. 📝 Get the basic app running
2. 📚 Upload and display your first ebook
3. 🔍 Learn about the codebase structure

### This Month:
1. 🎨 Build the ebook reader interface  
2. 🔤 Add Japanese text processing
3. 📖 Implement dictionary lookups

## 💡 Tips for Success

### **Start Small**
Don't try to implement everything at once. Focus on one feature, get it working, then move to the next.

### **Learn by Doing**
The best way to learn programming is to write code. Don't just read about concepts—implement them.

### **Embrace Errors**
Errors are learning opportunities. Read error messages carefully and use them to understand what's happening.

### **Join Communities**
- Reddit: /r/learnpython, /r/webdev, /r/LearnJapanese
- Discord: Python Discord, FastAPI community
- Stack Overflow for specific technical questions

### **Document Your Journey**
Keep notes about what you learn, what works, and what doesn't. This will help you remember and share your progress.

## 🆘 When You Need Help

### **Common Issues and Solutions**
1. **"Module not found"** → Check if you're in the right directory and virtual environment is activated
2. **"Database connection failed"** → Make sure PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct
3. **"CORS errors"** → Check that your API and frontend URLs match the configuration
4. **"File upload fails"** → Verify file permissions and upload directory exists

### **Getting Unstuck**
1. Read the error message completely
2. Google the exact error message
3. Check Stack Overflow
4. Ask in programming communities
5. Break the problem into smaller pieces
6. Use print/console.log statements to debug

### **Resources Always Available**
- 📖 `docs/LEARNING_ROADMAP.md` - Detailed development plan
- 📊 `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md` - Complete database reference
- ⚙️ `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` - Setup and troubleshooting guide
- 💬 AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude) for explanations and debugging

## 🌟 Remember Why You're Doing This

You're building something **meaningful**:
- A tool to help you learn Japanese more effectively
